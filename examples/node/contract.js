  // Sophia contracts always have an `init` method which needs to be invoked,
  // even when the contract's `state` is `unit` (`()`). The arguments to
  // `init` have to be provided at deployment time and will be written to the
  // block as well, together with the contract's bytecode.

  // will not only be rewarded a fixed amount, but also an amount depending on
  // the amount of gas spend.
